## FAQ

### What is the difference between DummyItemsBlocks and this plugin?
This plugin aims to provide many vanilla features and not just "dummies".

It is easier and faster to program a plugin than to wait for a pull request, but I like to support PocketMine so I would be happy if someone would implement this code in PocketMine.
